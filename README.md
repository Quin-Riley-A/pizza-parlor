This README will function as a note taking document for the moment before transitioning to a properly formatted readme as functionality develops.
The complete sequence of business logic tests can be found [here](/tests.md).
Initial construction will go as follows:

* ~~*Build initial Pizza constructor function using TDD~~

* ~~*Build Pizza prototype methodology for deriving price using TDD~~

* ~~Build initial form and UI for user to input selected pizza~~

* ~~link form to backend logic so user can successfully generate one pizza object~~

* build UI to display total price as table with breakdown

* ~~*build initial constructor for order object which stores pizzas using TDD~~

* ~~*build method to generate a unique ID for each pizza in an order object using TDD~~

* ~~*build method to find a specific pizza and return its ID using TDD~~

* ~~*build in ability to add multiple pizzas to an order (will likely involve developing TDD for several functions further)~~

* ~~*add methodology to remove pizza from order using none-other than (you guessed it!) TDD~~
